# RoundRobinArbiter

A Round Robin Arbiter is a type of scheduling algorithm used to allocate resources among multiple competing entities in a time-shared manner. It operates by cycling through a list of requesters (e.g., processes, threads, devices) in a fixed order, ensuring that each entity gets a fair share of the resource. The arbiter grants access to one requester at a time, then moves to the next in the list. When all requesters have been served, the arbiter restarts from the beginning of the list, thus making the process circularâ€”hence the name "round robin."

Round Robin Arbitration is widely used in networking (to share bandwidth), computer systems (to manage processor time), and in memory controllers (to arbitrate between multiple memory accesses).

Key Concepts:
Fairness: Each requester gets equal opportunity to access the resource, reducing starvation.
Simplicity: The algorithm is easy to implement, as it simply cycles through the entities in a predetermined order.
Deterministic: The order of access is predefined, making the algorithm predictable.
Time Slices in Round Robin:
Round Robin arbitration can be designed to allow requesters access to resources for either fixed or variable time slices:

1. Round Robin Arbiter with Fixed Time Slices:
In this type of arbiter, each requester is given access to the resource for a fixed amount of time, also known as a quantum or time slice. Once the time slice expires, the next requester in the list is granted access. The duration of the time slice remains constant across all requesters.

Characteristics:
Equal Time Allocation: All requesters get an equal amount of time to use the resource.
Simpler to Implement: Since the time slice is fixed, the arbiter doesn't need to account for different time allocations.
Less Flexibility: Fixed time slices might not be ideal in situations where some tasks need more time than others to complete efficiently.
Example:
Consider a CPU scheduler that manages three tasks (A, B, C). If the time slice is fixed at 10 milliseconds, each task gets exactly 10 ms before the arbiter switches to the next task. After serving C, the arbiter will cycle back to A.

2. Round Robin Arbiter with Variable Time Slices:
In this type, the time slice allocated to each requester can vary. The arbiter may allocate more time to higher-priority tasks or tasks that need more time to complete, while allocating shorter time slices to less critical or faster tasks.

Characteristics:
Flexibility: The arbiter can allocate time slices dynamically based on the requirements of each requester, task, or priority level.
Better Resource Utilization: Variable time slices can optimize the resource usage by giving more time to tasks that need it while ensuring that smaller tasks finish quickly.
More Complex: Implementing variable time slices adds complexity, as the arbiter must decide how to assign time slices dynamically.
Example:
In the same CPU scheduler scenario with tasks A, B, and C, task A might be I/O-bound and needs only 5 ms, task B might be compute-heavy and requires 20 ms, while task C may be low-priority and gets 10 ms. The arbiter dynamically allocates these time slices based on task requirements.
